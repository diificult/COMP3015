#COMP3015 PROJECT



##How to run the project.

1. Download the zip file
2. Extract the files
3. Run the EXE

 The program will open and you can view the scene, there is no interaction. The scene may take a moment to load.
 You can open the program as many times as you need, and the scene will start from scratch. If you want to edit the obj, replace cat.obj with any obj, that you want, and rename to cat.obj. Do not recommend this as you will have the rely on the scale of the object, where as the cat has been adjusted for the scene.

##How does the program code work?

For the code, the scene_uniform deals with the main code. This code has all of the links to each of the shaders. There are multiple shaders each with their names describing what they do. 


##The importance of the project

I added multiple shaders to single objects. I started with the bling phong project from the first coursework to then continue to improve and add complex shaders. This is a demostration of shaders for Open-GL
